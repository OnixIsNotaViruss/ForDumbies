## Onix is a very popular minecraft client but people often think its a virus cuz of the anti viruses now in this article im going to prove that onix client is a legit client and is not suspicsious


# Onix Is Not a Virus

here is the thing, onix is a game laucher which is so god damn gud! and now im going to proove it ok 

its an exe file, sounds suspicious, right? 

yes it does but it doesnt mean that its a virus now we are going to see a video containing the proof for it im downloading it from scrath for ya guys 

download it from - [here](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher/releases/latest/download/OnixLauncher.exe?raw=true) and 

just open it 

click launch EZ 

ITS DONE

now for the actual proof, 

onix is a thing which injects some stuff to your minecraft game, and microsoft is the owner of minecraft so they dont want you to inject anything on it so 
it will flag it as a virus, you must not belive that. Onix is sometimes flagged as a virus so you can just disable your anti virus and done ! 

onix is so god damn safe that it has so many users, you can see the discord member count ! more than 150k 

many popular minecraft youtubers made videos about it 

its seriously ON TOP!

ONIX CLIENT ON TOP!!!
